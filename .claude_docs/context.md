# Soul Winning App - Development Context

## Project Purpose
This application is designed specifically for church soul winning teams who go out on Saturday mornings to share the gospel and connect with people in their communities. The primary users are church members who need a quick, reliable way to capture and manage contact information while in the field.

## Current Implementation Status
**Status**: Initial Development Phase
**Started**: [Current Date]
**Phase**: Documentation and Setup

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Project structure creation (client/, server/, .claude_docs/)
- [x] Comprehensive requirements documentation
- [x] Technical architecture design
- [ ] MongoDB database models and schema
- [ ] Express server setup with middleware
- [ ] React application initialization
- [ ] Authentication system implementation
- [ ] Contact management functionality
- [ ] Notes system with date ordering
- [ ] Search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Mobile-responsive UI design
- [ ] Testing and validation

## Key Development Decisions

### Technology Choices
1. **MongoDB over PostgreSQL**:
   - Chosen for flexibility with contact data structure
   - Easy to add custom fields without schema migrations
   - Better fit for rapid development and deployment

2. **JWT Authentication**:
   - Stateless authentication suitable for mobile usage
   - Easy to implement across React and Express
   - Scalable for future mobile app development

3. **React Context over Redux**:
   - Simpler state management for moderate complexity
   - Reduces bundle size and learning curve
   - Sufficient for current application scope

### Design Priorities
1. **Mobile-First Development**: Primary usage will be on smartphones during field work
2. **Offline Resilience**: Graceful handling of poor network conditions
3. **Speed**: Quick data entry and retrieval for field use
4. **Simplicity**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal training

## User Context and Workflow

### Typical Saturday Morning Workflow
1. **Pre-Departure**: Team members log in and review previous contacts
2. **Field Work**: Quick contact entry while talking to people
3. **Immediate Notes**: Capture conversation details and prayer requests
4. **Follow-up Planning**: Tag contacts for different types of follow-up
5. **Post-Outreach**: Review and organize contacts from the day

### User Pain Points (Current Manual Process)
- **Paper Notes**: Easy to lose, hard to search, weather-dependent
- **Phone Notes**: Disorganized, no structure, hard to share insights
- **Memory Reliance**: Important details forgotten between conversations
- **Follow-up Chaos**: No systematic way to prioritize return visits

## Technical Constraints and Considerations

### Mobile Device Limitations
- **Screen Size**: Interface must work well on small screens
- **Touch Input**: Large tap targets, easy scrolling
- **Battery Usage**: Minimize resource-intensive operations
- **Network**: Handle intermittent connectivity gracefully

### Church Environment Considerations
- **Privacy**: Contact information must be secure and user-isolated
- **Simplicity**: Users may not be technically sophisticated
- **Reliability**: System must work consistently during outreach times

## Security and Privacy Requirements

### Data Sensitivity
Contact information includes:
- Personal names and addresses
- Phone numbers
- Spiritual conversation details
- Personal prayer requests

### Compliance Considerations
- **Data Ownership**: Each user owns only their contacts
- **Access Control**: No admin access to user data
- **Data Retention**: User-controlled data lifecycle
- **Export Capability**: Users can extract their own data

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- React development tools
- Git for version control

### Local Development
```bash
# Start MongoDB service
# Install dependencies for both client and server
# Run development servers concurrently
```

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Phase 2 Features
- **Team Coordination**: Optional contact sharing within teams
- **Reporting**: Basic statistics and follow-up tracking
- **Export**: CSV export for external tools
- **Mapping**: GPS location tagging for contacts

### Phase 3 Possibilities
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android applications
- **Offline Support**: Full offline capability with sync
- **Integration**: Church management system integration
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with filters

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- **Component Structure**: Small, focused, reusable components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex business logic

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Critical business logic and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **User Testing**: Field testing with actual soul winners
- **Performance Testing**: Mobile device performance validation

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with hot reloading
- Local MongoDB instance or Atlas development cluster
- Environment variables for configuration

### Production Environment
- MongoDB Atlas for database hosting
- Heroku or Vercel for application hosting
- Environment-based configuration
- SSL/HTTPS enforcement

## Support and Maintenance

### User Support
- **Documentation**: Simple user guide with screenshots
- **Training**: Brief training sessions for church teams
- **Feedback Loop**: Regular user feedback collection
- **Issue Tracking**: Simple way for users to report problems

### Technical Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Security patches and dependency updates
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups
- **Monitoring**: Basic application health monitoring
- **Performance**: Regular performance review and optimization

## Success Metrics

### User Adoption
- Number of active users per Saturday
- Average contacts entered per user
- User retention after initial training

### System Performance
- Page load times on mobile devices
- Search response times
- System uptime during peak usage (Saturday mornings)

### User Satisfaction
- Feedback scores from regular users
- Reduction in lost contact information
- Improvement in follow-up completion rates
