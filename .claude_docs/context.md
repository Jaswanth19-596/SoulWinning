## Key Development Decisions

### Technology Choices
1. **MongoDB with Field-Level Encryption**:
   - Chosen for flexibility with contact data structure
   - Implemented enterprise-grade AES-256-CBC encryption
   - Easy to add custom fields without schema migrations
   - Automatic encryption/decryption at model level

2. **TypeScript + React 18**:
   - Type safety and better developer experience
   - Modern hooks and functional components
   - Enhanced tooling and error catching

3. **JWT Authentication with Secure Storage**:
   - Stateless authentication suitable for mobile usage
   - Client-side encryption for token storage
   - Automatic refresh and expiration handling

4. **React Context over Redux**:
   - Simpler state management for moderate complexity
   - Multiple contexts for separation of concerns
   - Sufficient for current application scope with better performance

5. **Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion**:
   - Utility-first CSS for rapid development
   - Built-in dark mode and responsive design
   - Smooth animations and professional UI

### Design Priorities
1. **Mobile-First Development**: Primary usage will be on smartphones during field work
2. **Offline Resilience**: Graceful handling of poor network conditions
3. **Speed**: Quick data entry and retrieval for field use
4. **Simplicity**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal training

## User Context and Workflow

### Typical Saturday Morning Workflow
1. **Pre-Departure**: Team members log in and review previous contacts
2. **Field Work**: Quick contact entry while talking to people
3. **Immediate Notes**: Capture conversation details and prayer requests
4. **Follow-up Planning**: Tag contacts for different types of follow-up
5. **Post-Outreach**: Review and organize contacts from the day

### User Pain Points (Current Manual Process)
- **Paper Notes**: Easy to lose, hard to search, weather-dependent
- **Phone Notes**: Disorganized, no structure, hard to share insights
- **Memory Reliance**: Important details forgotten between conversations
- **Follow-up Chaos**: No systematic way to prioritize return visits

## Technical Constraints and Considerations

### Mobile Device Limitations
- **Screen Size**: Interface must work well on small screens
- **Touch Input**: Large tap targets, easy scrolling
- **Battery Usage**: Minimize resource-intensive operations
- **Network**: Handle intermittent connectivity gracefully

### Church Environment Considerations
- **Privacy**: Contact information must be secure and user-isolated
- **Simplicity**: Users may not be technically sophisticated
- **Reliability**: System must work consistently during outreach times

## Security and Privacy Requirements

### Data Sensitivity
Contact information includes:
- Personal names and addresses
- Phone numbers
- Spiritual conversation details
- Personal prayer requests

### Compliance Considerations
- **Data Ownership**: Each user owns only their contacts
- **Access Control**: No admin access to user data
- **Data Retention**: User-controlled data lifecycle
- **Export Capability**: Users can extract their own data

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- React development tools
- Git for version control

### Local Development
```bash
# Start MongoDB service
# Install dependencies for both client and server
# Run development servers concurrently
```

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Phase 2 Features
- **Team Coordination**: Optional contact sharing within teams
- **Reporting**: Basic statistics and follow-up tracking
- **Export**: CSV export for external tools
- **Mapping**: GPS location tagging for contacts

### Phase 3 Possibilities
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android applications
- **Offline Support**: Full offline capability with sync
- **Integration**: Church management system integration
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with filters

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- **Component Structure**: Small, focused, reusable components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex business logic

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Critical business logic and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **User Testing**: Field testing with actual soul winners
- **Performance Testing**: Mobile device performance validation

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with hot reloading
- Local MongoDB instance or Atlas development cluster
- Environment variables for configuration

### Production Environment
- MongoDB Atlas for database hosting
- Heroku or Vercel for application hosting
- Environment-based configuration
- SSL/HTTPS enforcement

## Support and Maintenance

### User Support
- **Documentation**: Simple user guide with screenshots
- **Training**: Brief training sessions for church teams
- **Feedback Loop**: Regular user feedback collection
- **Issue Tracking**: Simple way for users to report problems

### Technical Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Security patches and dependency updates
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups
- **Monitoring**: Basic application health monitoring
- **Performance**: Regular performance review and optimization

## Success Metrics

### User Adoption
- Number of active users per Saturday
- Average contacts entered per user
